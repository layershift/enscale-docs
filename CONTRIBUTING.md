### About Enscale docs
#### Structure
Generally articles should fit in one of the already existing chapters of the documentation, new articles can be created by adding a new folder in the respective directory. 

The order articles appear in a section is determined by the number of the directory. If there are multiple numbered directories in the folder already, please either give a consecutive number to your new article or leave it without and we will order it for you.

In case you believe a new chapter or subchapter should be added to the documentation, please create your article under one of the existing chapters and in the comment section indicate the proposed new chapter/subchapter name.

#### Formatting

Enscale docs articles uses markdown, so formatting should be pretty straight-forward. In addition to this we use anchor tags, so you can create internal links to a specific heading by referencing the directory path to your article and appending the hearer with an #.

Example for internal link:

```[text you want to link](/../environments/access/access-via-ssh#add-your-ssh-key)```

#### Images
Images need to be uploaded to the article's directory, then they can be referenced in the article.
