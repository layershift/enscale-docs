In the overview tab you will also find the following buttons, from left to right:

**[File Manager](/features/file-manager)**: browser based access to the node's file system including log file access.

**Restart node**: restart this individual node (e.g. to activate a configuration change)

**Open in browser**: direct URL to access this specific node via HTTP

**Delete**: delete this node.

 
##### Statistics

View your Memory and CPU usage, Traffic activity, and Storage used / free. The graphs provide a toggle between live statistics and historical data. Hover over the graph to see exact values. Highlight to zoom.

##### Connect tab
![](ConnectTab.jpg)

**IP address **

Add (or view) a public IP address to the node. View the nodeâ€™s private IP address. [Learn more about Enscale IP addresses](/features/ip-addresses).

**SSH/SFTP**

[SSH](/access/access-via-ssh) and [SFTP](access/access-via-sftp) connection details for direct connection to the node. The connect button will launch your SSH client (if ssh:// handler is registered in your OS). The manage SSH keys button provides a shortcut to your [SSH key management](/access/add-ssh-key) area.

SSH keys must be managed separately per Enscale dashboard user; collaborators access nodes via their own keys managed from their own Enscale dashboard.

**FTP/FTPS**

Add the optional FTP feature to the node to activate [FTP / FTPS functionality](/access/ftpftps). Once installed you login details are sent via email, this area updates to contain the FTP connection string, password reset, and the option to remove the FTP feature.

FTP is activated / deactivated for all nodes of the same type in your environment simultaneously.

! FTP connection requires a public IP on the node.

##### Scaling tab
Here you can set the resource limits used to scale your application [vertically](/features/vertical-scaling). Below that you can configure automatic [horizontal scaling](/features/horizontal-scaling) triggers to add and remove nodes when resource usage reaches certain thresholds.

##### Configure tab

In the configure tab you will find the current version of your specific node and are able to change it for that specific node only. Additonally for database nodes you will find connection details and admin panel access under this tab.

Use the **Variables** button to set [environment variables](/features/environment-variables) for the node that you can reference in your application code.
