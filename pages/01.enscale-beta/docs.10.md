### What is Enscale Beta?

After years of prep and perfecting we've finally decided to take the first and probably biggest step, we launched Enscale Beta. 
The scope of the private beta is to allow us time to concentrate on the valuable feedback given by a select few participants and make sure Enscale is a real problem-solver in the world of hosting, not "just another PaaS".

### How to apply?

We accept applications continuously, all you need to do is fill out this short [form](https://enscale.com/Form).

### Why should you apply?

1. First of all, you get a major say in the way we develop Enscale - whatever problems you may be facing with your hosting provider now can become a thing of the past. Let us know about it, listen to possible solutions and choose the best or propose a completely different one - the power is in your hands.
2. All setvice is provided 100% free of charve throughout the beta
3. In exchange for feedback you also receive free hosting credits you can spend after commercial launch.
4. We have a monhtly prize draw for a Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit (your name gets in the hat once per actionable feedback received in the given month)

### What are the rules?

1. Due to the demand, we have to be very selective of people we accept as participants - you'll receive an email within max 1 week of sending your application regarding acceptance. 
2. We promise not to impose any charges or terminate your account without warning (other than due to a serious breach of our AUP), but if it appears that you're no longer actively participating in the beta we'll reach out to you and may ultimately need to make your spot available to someone else.
3. We intend to provide you with a 100% uptime, highly performant and stable platform - even during the beta. However, our beta has no SLA, and as such you understand there are no guarantees: service may be unavailable, unstable, or you might lose all data. The beta is a place for testing, and proof-of-concept - it's not for production workloads.
4. Prize draw is organized and winners are announced during the first week of each month for last months' participation.

### What are the limitations?

1. No SLA guarantee
2. Hosting location restricted to UK region
3. Account limits: 
* Number of environments: 20
* Number of nodes per environment: 20
* RAM limit: 16GiB
* CPU limit: 51200Mhz
* Disk limit: 50GB
* Public IPv4: YES
* IPv6: NO
* FTP access: YES
* SSH access: YES
* ROOT SSH access: NO
* Domain binding: YES
* SSL: YES
* Collaboration: YES

We've attempted to set very inclusive limits to allow our users to test Enscale for production scenarios as well to provide feedback. We ask that you keep in mind that Enscale Beta is more than "free hosting", we'd hate to have to be more restrictive due to abuse of the current limits.
