This app was created so you can familiarize yourself with some of the basic Enscale features you are likely to need for your own application. As such, we recommend that you deploy it and go through the guided steps to get a feel for the dashboard and how things work.

Going through the quickstart app takes about 20 minutes (wait-times included), and you'll definitely learn a lot, however shoud this not be enough of incentive, once all the steps are completed, you can claim Â£20 credit for your Enscale account to prolong your trial period whilst you test your custom application on our platform.

### How to complete the Quickstart app?

The steps provided below are specifically for the demo app, but at the end of each step there's a link to additional documentation about the features used in case you want to find out more about them.

###### Step 1

You need to create an environment, with a single Nginx Ruby node. From the Enscale dashboard, click **Add new environment**, once on the environment screen, click **Create**. For the purposes of the demo the defaults are okay, you may of course change the region or environment name if you prefer.

Learn more about [creating environments](/getting-started/create-environment).

###### Step 2

Now that you have the environment, you need to deploy the Quickstart application. For this enter the environment (**Enter** button on the environment's tile), and click **Deploy**.

The Quickstart app is on GitHub and can be deployed with a single click on **Deploy** (we've prefilled the link and as this is a public application there is no need for any authentincation). 

Learn more about [deployment options](/deployments).
Learn more about [git deployments](/deployments/git).

###### Step 3

The quickstart app is deployed, so you can open it to see what else you can learn about. To open the application you can use the **Open in browser** option from the hamburger menu from your project or if you go back to your environment, you can click on the **Globe** icon on your node. 

Learn more about the [managing your deployments](/deployments/deployment-manager).

###### Step 4

First you're asked to add a redis database node to the environment. This can be done from the Environment's screen by clicking **Add new node**. Select **NoSQL** type and from there click on **Redis**. Next you will need to select the prefered version (any version should do for the purposes of this application).

When the database is added to your environment, you will receive an email with its details, like the access URL and password. You will need these for the next step.

###### Step 5

Add an environment variable with the database URL to your application node. This variable will make the connection between the database and your application more secure as you won't need to use the Redis password in your code.

On your Nginx Ruby node click on the **Configure** tab and click **Variables**. Click **Add new variable** and enter the following:

Name: REDIS_URL
Value: redis://:`[redis_password]`@`[accessURL]` - for example redis://:IOVrsn82356@node23469-demoapplicationnew.uk.enscaled.com

Click **Add** then **Save changes**.
