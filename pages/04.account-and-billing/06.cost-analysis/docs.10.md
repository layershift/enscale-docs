As you probably know by now, with Enscale you pay for the resources you use each hour so we provide you with a detailed cost analysis section where you can keep an eye on what you use and how much you pay for it. 

There are four paid resources in Enscale: 

* Cloudlets (RAM + CPU)
* Public IP address 
* Traffic 
* Disk space

In the Cost Analysis section you can see a breakdown of costs per account, environment and specific node for the last 24 hours, 30 days as well as entire months.

You can access Cost Analysis from the main account dropdown:
