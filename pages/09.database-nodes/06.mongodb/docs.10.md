In this section you can learn more about your MongoDB database server in Enscale. We tried to gather some useful tips as well as Enscale-specific information you should know, so be sure to skim trhough the articles.

MongoDB comes with Mongo Express administration panel, which you can access by using the **Go to Admin Panel** button from the **Configure** tab of your database node. The login details are emailed to you. Once in the panel, you should create a new user and database, detailed steps can be found in the [User creation](/database-nodes/mongodb/user-creation) article.

To learn more about how to reference the database in your application code, read our [connection details article](/database-nodes/mongodb/connection-details).

For general queries about MongoDB, be sure to read their [official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/).
