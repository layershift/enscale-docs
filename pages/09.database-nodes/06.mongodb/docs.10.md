In this section you can learn more about your MongoDB CE (Community Edition) database server in Enscale. We tried to gather some useful tips as well as Enscale-specific information you should know, so be sure to skim trhough the articles.

MongoDB comes with an administration panel, which you can access by using the **Go to Admin Panel** button from the **Configure** tab of your database node. The login details are emailed to you. We suggest to [create a new user](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/create-users/) with limited privileges to use in your code though.

To learn more about how to reference the database in your application code, read our [connection details article](/database-nodes/mongodb/connection-details).

For general queries about MongoDB, be sure to read their [official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/).
