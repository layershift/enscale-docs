In this section you can learn more about your MariaDB database server in Enscale. We tried to gather some useful tips as well as Enscale-specific information you should know, so be sure to skim trhough the articles.

MariaDB comes with phpMyAdmin administration panel, which you can access by using the **Go to phpMyAdmin** button from the **Configure** tab of your database node. The login details are emailed to you.

Once in the panel, you should create a new user and database, detailed steps can be found in the [User creation](/database-nodes/mariadb/user-creation) article.

To learn more about how to reference the database in your application code, read our [connection details article](/database-nodes/mariadb/connection-details).

Furhtermore, you can see the default environment [variables for a MariaDB](/database-nodes/mariadb/mariadb-variables) node, keep in mind that these variables can be referenced in your code as well with a "_mariadb_\_" prefix.

For general queries about MariaDB, be sure to read their [official documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/). 

We're working hard on expanding our documentation, so if there's any specific topic of interest you think we should add, please [email us](mailto:support@enscale.com) - or [contribute](https://github.com/layershift/enscale-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to our articles in GitHub ;-)
