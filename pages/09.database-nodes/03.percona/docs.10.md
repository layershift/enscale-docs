In this section you can learn more about your Percona database server in Enscale. We tried to gather some useful tips as well as Enscale-specific information you should know, so be sure to skim trhough the articles.

Percona comes with phpMyAdmin administration panel, which you can access by using the **Go to Admin Panel** button from the **Configure** tab of your database node. The login details are emailed to you. Once in the panel, you should create a new user and database, detailed steps can be found in the [User creation](/database-nodes/percona/user-creation) article.

To learn more about how to reference the database in your application code, read our [connection details article](/database-nodes/percona/connection-details).

For general queries about Percona, be sure to read their [official documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/index.html ). 

We're working hard on expanding our documentation, so if there's any specific topic of interest you think we should add, please [email us](mailto:support@enscale.com) - or [contribute](https://github.com/layershift/enscale-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to our articles in GitHub ;-)
