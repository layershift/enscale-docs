In this section you can learn more about your Redis database server in Enscale. We tried to gather some useful tips as well as Enscale-specific information you should know, so be sure to skim trhough the articles.

Redis comes with an administration panel, which you can access by using the direct link to your your database node. The login details are emailed to you. We suggest to [create a new user](https://redis.io/topics/security) with limited privileges to use in your code though.

To learn more about how to reference the database in your application code, read our [connection details article](/database-nodes/redis/connection-details).

For general queries about Redis, be sure to read their [official documentation](https://redis.io/documentation).
