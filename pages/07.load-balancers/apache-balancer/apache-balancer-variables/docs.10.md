Here is a list of pre-defined environment variables on apache load balancer nodes. Most of these are informational only, meaning that editing them will not change your environment's configuration.

In the tables below you can find the pre-defined environment variables as well as see which are the informational ones.

To add your own environment variables follow the steps outlined in our feature description article: [Environment Variables](https://enscale.com/docs/10/features/environment-variables).
