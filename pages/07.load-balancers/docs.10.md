A load balancer server comes in handy when you have multiple runtime nodes - it will be set to automatically distribute requests between your servers. If you're using a public IP address, please make sure to update your DNS zone to point all requests toward the load balancer node.

We offer four load balancer server types for you to choose from:

[Apahce load balancer](https://enscale.com/docs/10/load-balancers/apache-balancer/)
[HAProxy load balancer](https://enscale.com/docs/10/load-balancers/haproxy)
[Ngnix load balancer](https://enscale.com/docs/10/load-balancers/nginx-balancer)
[Varnis balancer](https://enscale.com/docs/10/load-balancers/varnish)
