You can deploy your Java application to Enscale by the following means:

* [Deploy a WAR/EAR archive directly](/java/deployment-guides/war-or-ear-deployment)
* [Deploy using git](/java/deployment-guides/git)
* [Deploy from SVN](/java/deployment-guides/svn)

Additionally for all Git and SVN deployments, Enscale uses a [Maven build environment](/java/deployment-guides/maven-build-node) to help build your project.
