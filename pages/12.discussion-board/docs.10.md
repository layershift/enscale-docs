We at Enscale hold our users in the highest regard and would like to do everything possible to have their voices heard. The Enscale discussion board is another way to give You the opportunity to help us shape Enscale (by using the **Wishing Well**), seek out help from the Community (**Having trouble with...**) as well as stay on top of latest Enscale related **News**. If you'd like to see any category added in particular, shoot us an email.

The discussion board is exclusive to people with Enscale accounts, so you can be sure to receive relevant help to your questions.
