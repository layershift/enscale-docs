There are very few developers nowadays who donâ€™t use some sort of version control system.

You can store your repository anywhere on the Internet or on your home server, as long as you are using Subversion as a source control management tool, we've got you covered!

Enscale makes life really easy for developers; we give you a way to deploy your code directly from your repository.

### Deploy your application

##### Step 1

Enter your environment and click **Deploy** to enter the Deployment manager.

##### Step 2

Click **Deploy a new project** to deploy your SVN project. (Only archives are saved as existing projects).

##### Step 3



Select the **SVN tab** from the drop-down menu to provide us with a link to your repository.

**URL**: the URL of your SVN repository

**Authentication method**:

* None: use this if your repository does not require authentication
* Password: use this if your repository requires a username and password for access

**Auto-update**: turn this on for Enscale to check your repository regularly for updates. The frequency of checks is set by you in the auto-update interval section. If any changes are detected, Enscale will also re-deploy your application. 

**Auto-resolve conflicts**: toggle on instructs Enscale to update any contradictory files to the ones in the repository to prevent merge conflicts during re-deploy.

**Deploy hooks**: Here you can enter custom scripts to run before (Pre) or after (Post) deployment. Enter the script in the appropriate tab and click **Apply** to save it.

 
##### Step 5

Click **Deploy**.

##### Handling conflicts during updates

The recommended workflow is:
* Make changes on your local development environment.
* Commit to your SVN repo. 
* Check out to your Enscale environment.

If you need to make any changes or additions directly to your Enscale environment (e.g. user-uploaded files), you should use _svn:ignore_ properties to omit them.

To protect you from unexpected data loss, Enscale does not automatically force a deployment if edits / additions made to your environment result in a merge conflict.

If you find that an updated code revision is not deployed as expected, you should review the [SVN logs](/troubleshooting/log-files/gitsvn-logs) to identify and resolve the root cause of a merge conflict, then try the deploy once again.
